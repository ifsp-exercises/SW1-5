# 🚀 How to run

Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed in your machine. Then, just run `docker-compose up` to start the containers.

The `mysql:8.0.24` and `tomcat:9.0` are required and will be downloaded automatically if not found.

# 💻 How to develop

To develop new features or make some experiments, just run `docker-compose up`, and then every change made in `./` will be reflected inside the containers.
